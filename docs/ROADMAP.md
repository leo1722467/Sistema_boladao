## Open Issues
- **File watcher noise**: Excessive watchfiles change detection during development — cosmetic only
- **Testing coverage**: Limited test coverage for business logic and API endpoints — priority for Phase 3
- **Ticket state machine**: Need to implement status transition validation and workflow rules
- **SLA management**: Implement SLA tracking, escalation rules, and automated notifications
- **Performance optimization**: Add caching strategies and database query optimization
- **Event system**: Implement outbox pattern for domain events and webhook notifications

## Decisions Log
- **Auth stabilization**: Added startup diagnostics, global HTTP middleware, file logging
- **Architecture alignment**: Multi-tenant helpdesk with inventory→assets→tickets→service orders
- **Tenant model**: `UserAuth → Contato → Empresa` provides scoping context
- **Service layer**: Domain services will encapsulate validation, state transitions, events

## Core Functional Flows

### Inventory Intake → Asset Creation
1. `Estoque` created within company scope → triggers event
2. `AssetService` creates `Ativo`, linking `stock_unit_id` and generating serial

### Ticket Creation
1. `TicketService.create_ticket(empresa_id, ativo_id, ...)` validates asset-company consistency
2. Applies default status/priority rules per category or SLA

### Service Order Lifecycle
1. `ServiceOrderService.create_from_ticket(chamado_id)` generates OS with `numero_os`
2. `ServiceOrderService.ensure_ticket(os_id, ativo_id)` creates missing Chamado if required
